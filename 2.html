<h2>what is HTML?</h2>
<P>HTML is a computer language that is devised to simplify website creation. HTML stands for HyperText Markup Language. Hypertext refers to the method in which people move around the internet or a website– by clicking on hyperlinks. Markup refers to what HTML tags to do the text that is within them. Most people can get relatively familiar with HTML tags if they want to customize a blog or make changes to their website. HTML does have its own codes and syntax like any other computer language and understanding them is what makes the difference between an okay website and a great website.</p>
<p style="margin-top:30px;">A website is actually just an HTML document: a series of codes that is then interpreted by a web browser to present what you see when you pull up a website. When just starting out using HTML to code a website, your focus will be on basic tags. You will need an opening tag and a closing tag for your HTML to work. For example, to make a section of text bold, you would use the bold tag “<b> before any text that you wanted to be bold. Then, at the end of the text that you wanted bold, you would close the tag </b>”. Almost all tags will need an opening and a closing tag, but there are some exceptions.</P><img src="pic2.webp" width="40%">

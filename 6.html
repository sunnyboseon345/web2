<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<P>If you are interested in learning how to build a website, then there are a number of online tutorials that can give you a basic understanding of HTML and provide a reference for the different tags. However, if you really want to create good websites and web applications, then you might want to consider something like a coding bootcamp. A coding bootcamp can teach you everything you need to know to become a professional website developer in just a few months.</p>
<p> Coding a website with HTML takes practice and a bit of research. You can do it on your own, but consider looking into a coding bootcamp or online web course to get a real understanding of HTML.  By experimenting with HTML and creating your own websites, you build a portfolio that can impress future employers.</p><img src="pic3.jpg" width="40%">
